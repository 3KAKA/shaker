description:
  This scenario launches pairs of VMs on different compute nodes. VMs are in
  the different networks connected via different routers, master accesses slave
  by floating ip

deployment:
  template: l3_north_south.hot
  accommodation: [pair, single_room, zones: [nova, vcenter], cross_az]

execution:
  progression: quadratic
  tests:
  -
    title: Download
    class: flent
    method: tcp_download
    sla:
    - "[type == 'agent'] >> (stats.tcp_download.mean > 900)"
    - "[type == 'agent'] >> (stats.ping_icmp.max < 0.5)"
  -
    title: Upload
    class: flent
    method: tcp_upload
    sla:
    - "[type == 'agent'] >> (stats.tcp_upload.mean > 900)"
    - "[type == 'agent'] >> (stats.ping_icmp.max < 0.5)"
  -
    title: Bi-directional
